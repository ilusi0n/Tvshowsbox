### What is this repository for? ###

* A script written in python that manages all your TV Shows in a sqlite database.
* Version 0.1

### Why you did this? ###

* I know that there is websites which have this functionality and a lot of more features. I do use one of those sites but only to know where a specific TV Show is and when is released. For mark watch episodes I used to write on a txt file on my computer. With this script I don't need it anymore.
* I'm quite new in python, so don't expect a really good code.
