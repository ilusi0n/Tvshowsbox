### TVShowsBox ###

* A script written in python that manages all your TV Shows in a sqlite database.
* WIP
* Version 0.1

### Why you did this? ###

* I know that there is websites which have this functionality and a lot of more features. I do use one of those sites but only to know where a specific TV Show is and when is released. For mark watch episodes I used to write on a txt file on my computer. With this script I don't need it anymore.
* I'm quite new in python, so don't expect a really good code.

### Dependencies ###

* Python (obviously)
* Sqlite
* [Clint, a Python Command-line Application Tools](https://github.com/kennethreitz/clint)

### Features ###

* Add TV Shows and Animes
* Delete TV Shows and Animes
* Edit a Show
* Mark next episode as watched
* Support for partial search
* List all TV Shows and Animes
* List Wanted List
* Support for a wanted list
* TV Show or Anime is removed from the Wanted List, if the user add it to the currently watched shows

### TODO ###

* Import/export the database (to and from a file)
* Mark a specific episode as watched only if is greater than the current watched episode

### Features that probably will not be added ###

* Security
